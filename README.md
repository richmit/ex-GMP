Here you will find several examples of source code intended to
illustrate some basic applications of GMP -- the GNU multi-precision
arithmetic library. While mostly intended to illustrate some
applications, this code might also be of use to someone learning how
to use GMP. 

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/GMP.html).

Have fun!
